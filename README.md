# Satoru Grub Theme

Gojo Satoru Grub theme because I like Jujutsu Kaisen and why not

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TRBF/satoru-grub-theme.git
```
Switch to the repository folder:
```
$ cd satoru-grub-theme 
```
Run the installation script:
```
$ ./install.sh
```

#### Notes:

1. This theme is inspired (and when I say inspired I mean I copied and adapted the code a little to make it fit my needs) by the [Sekiro Grub Theme](https://github.com/semimqmo/sekiro_grub_theme).
2. I didn't get the chance to take a screenshot of the theme. It's a weird process. If anyone's feeling like taking one for me go ahead, otherwise a later commit might come with it.
3. I read the manga.
